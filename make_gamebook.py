#***IMPORTANT NOTE: Every section within the document should bear a unique name, using a
#"** Section" section opening tag and closing asterisks (**), as exemplified by the following
#section title header: "** Section Exploration of the Caves **". The same section titles,
#without the opening tags or asterisks, but preceded by "turn to" and followed by a period
#(ex: "turn to Exploration of the Caves.") will be used throughout the section texts to refer
#to the the appropriate section title headers. It must be emphasized that the presence of two
#consecutive asterisks (**) before (within the "** Section" section tag) and after the section
#title header is required in order to locate the section titles within the text. Furthermore,
#a period is needed after a section title reference, so as to indicate the end of the random index
#(so that "turn to 1" is not confused with "turn to 11", for instance). All of the section title
#headers (ex: "** Section Exploration of the Caves **") and section title references
#(ex: "turn to Exploration of the Caves.") need to be spelled in the exact same way to ensure
#correct random index substitutions. Also, you should avoid putting any text before the first
#section or after the last section, as this text would be lost after splitting the document
#into individual sections. You should instead write separate foreword and afterword documents
#that will not be submitted to the present code. It is all the more important to check for
#typos in the first section opening tag ("** Section"), as if the second section opening tag is
#correctly written, such typos in the first section would result in its exclusion from the list of
#sections. You should avoid non-directional double quotes (") when writing your ".txt" document
#on your computer, as these characters are omitted in the rtf file. Documents should be redacted
#in a word processor that uses directional quotes and be saved in ".txt" or ".rtf" format.
